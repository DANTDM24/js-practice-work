THE SWITCH STATEMENTï»¿

Note - do this all in a file called practice-5.js

1. Use a switch statement to log the following string for the given language:

hindi: 'MOST number of native speakers!';

english: '2nd place in number of native speakers';

urdu: '3rd place';

bengali: 'Number 4';

for all other i.e the default case, simply log 'Great language too :D'.

To run ur file , type in the console "node practice-5.js" . Be sure to download nodejs before running it or u will get errors!

if you dont remember the switch statement, you can simply google once "Switch Statement in Nodejs". If you still dont understand , ask cat.
