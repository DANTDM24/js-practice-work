TAKING DECISIONS: IF / ELSE STATEMENTSï»¿

Note - DO this all in a file called practice-4.js

1. Create a variable called age and specify a age u want and then Create a "if-else" statement to compare if the age mentioned is over 70. Use console.log to print if the age is over 70 or not.

2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 20 and then to 100. See the different results, and set the age back to original.

To run ur file , type in the console "node practice-4.js" . Be sure to download nodejs before running it or u will get errors!
